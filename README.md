# VISUAL-STUDIO-PROJECTS

This repository serves as a portfolio for all coding projects and assignments
completed during The Tech Academy's **Visual Studio Course** within the UI/UX Design
program, specifically focusing on **C#** and the **ASP.NET Core** framework.

The projects within this repository highlight a progression of skills in
full-stack web development, utilizing the Visual Studio IDE, Git, and Razor Pages.

### Project Log

#### **Step 59: ASP.NET CORE WEB APP SCAFFOLD** 🏗️

- **Date**: November 9, 2025
- **Objective**: Create the initial environment for the Visual Studio course by
  scaffolding a base web application, configuring the solution, and establishing
  version control.
- **Outcome**:
  - The solution **`WebAppTutorial`** and project **`WebApp`** were created using
    the **ASP.NET Core Web App (Razor Pages)** template in Visual Studio 2022.
  - Configured to use **.NET 8 (LTS)** and enabled **HTTPS** for security and stability.
  - The local Git repository was initialized as **`VISUAL-STUDIO-PROJECTS`** and
    successfully published to GitHub, establishing the workflow for all subsequent
    assignments.

#### **Step 60: CREATING A WEB APPLICATION TUTORIAL** ⚙️

- **Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Objective**: Complete the Microsoft Learn tutorial to run, debug, and make
  basic C# and HTML changes to the scaffolded ASP.NET Core web application, focusing
  on Razor Pages structure.
- **Outcome**: Successfully implemented **Razor syntax** (`@ViewData`) to display
  a dynamic date on the Privacy page, generated in the C# code-behind file using
  `DateTime.Now.ToString()` with `System.Globalization`. Utilized **Visual Studio Quick Actions** to clean
  up C# code. **Note:** Due to an environment-specific port/firewall block, application launch
  was verified via command line, and code changes were implemented successfully but not visually confirmed in the browser.

  #### **Step 60: CREATING A WEB APPLICATION TUTORIAL** ⚙️

- **Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Objective**: Complete the Microsoft Learn tutorial to run, debug, and make
  basic C# and HTML changes to the scaffolded ASP.NET Core web application, focusing
  on Razor Pages structure.
- **Outcome**: Implemented **Razor syntax** (`@ViewData`) to display a dynamic date
  on the Privacy page, generated in the C# code-behind file using `DateTime.Now.ToString()`
  with `System.Globalization`. Successfully corrected C# syntax errors and verified all
  logic by running the re-scaffolded, stable project in the browser.

#### **Step 61: VS ASSIGNMENT (Favorite Animal)** 🖼️

- **Date**: November 10, 2025
- **Objective**: Complete a coding assignment by creating a new Razor Page that
  displays a picture of a favorite animal, demonstrating mastery of the Razor Pages
  structure and static file serving.
- **Outcome**: Successfully created the new **`Animal.cshtml`** Razor Page and its code-behind.
  The new project was initialized to fix persistent build and pathing errors caused by
  manual folder moves. All code for Step 61 was successfully compiled and visually verified
  to be working in the browser.
